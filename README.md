## Abstract


### 🚀 Key Features of TweetGuard

- **🛡️ Hybrid Architecture**: Combines Transformer and Bi-LSTM architectures to maximize the strengths of both for more accurate fake news detection.
  
- **🧠 Advanced Tokenization**: Utilizes **BERTweet** tokenization, which enhances the model's ability to understand context and detect nuanced misinformation in tweets.

- **🔄 Ablation Study**: Comprehensive analysis of individual and combined contributions of the Bi-LSTM and Transformer components to show performance improvement.

- **📊 High Accuracy**: Achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets with superior performance compared to existing models in the field.

- **📈 Benchmarking**: Extensive comparative analysis against traditional models like CNN, LSTM, and Transformer architectures to highlight superior performance.

- **🗂️ Robust Text Preprocessing**: Incorporates a powerful text-cleaning and standardization pipeline to prepare Twitter data for effective classification.

- **📉 Real-time Detection**: Capable of detecting fake news in real-time across a variety of informational settings.

- **📁 Cross-Dataset Validation**: Demonstrated high adaptability and robustness by testing across multiple fake news detection datasets, ensuring its reliability in diverse scenarios.
